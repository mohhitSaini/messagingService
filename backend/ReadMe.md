**WHY?**

Built on Django: DRF is built on top of the Django web framework, which means you can leverage Django's features, including its ORM, authentication, and security, while building your API.

Modularity: DRF provides a set of reusable and customizable components for building APIs, such as serializers, views, and authentication classes, making it easy to create well-structured APIs.
